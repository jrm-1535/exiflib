exiflib is a small library allowing to extract exif tags from TIFF metadata
that are comonly embedded in jpeg files. It has a dependency on a subset of
the C baselib library (slices).

The main functions are read_exif and parse_exif, which take a FILE pointer and
return a pointer to an opaque data structure exif_desc_t, and various getters
exif_get_xxx that return tags, types and values. The exif_desc_t data is freed
by calling exif_free after use.
